I tried. I truly tried my very best.

After 6+ hours of toiling away, I have come to the conclusion that making water is completely beyond my level of expertise.

All I could make was really messed up water. It reflected like garbage. Let this note be a resignation to the fact that
making water is beyond my skillset. I have given up and imported someone else's water.

I tried my best. My best wasn't good enough.

P.S. If you would like to observe my misery, uncomment the GrLake import in gr-01-01.js and comment out the other one. :')
