# Algorithms

Alright, so. There are a lot of algorithms, some of which are hard to understand and remember. Purely for myself, this is a database of all the ones I've learned and descriptions for myself to remind myself of what they are and how they work.

## Table of Contents

- [Resources](#resources)
- [Section 1: Graphs](#section-1-graphs)

## Resources

Here are some resources I've found (also for my own purposes):

- [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide)
- [Algorithms for Competitive Programming](https://cp-algorithms.com/index.html)
- [Google TechDev Guide](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/)

## Section 1: Graphs

Perhaps the most fundamental of concepts.
